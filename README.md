## Description

Typing Maze is a typing game that is played in a maze. The player must type the words that appear on the cell to move through the maze. The goal is to reach the flag. For future development, I will add more maps and levels and also a leaderboard to keep track of the fastest times. You can play the game [here](https://erik3010.github.io/typing-maze/).

This game was built using Javascript and HTML Canvas. I build this game to learn how to make a smooth animation using HTML Canvas and how to draw only the visible part of the map.

## How to play

Simply type the words that appear adjacent to your character to move through the maze. The goal is to reach the flag.
